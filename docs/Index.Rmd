# Markdown

Markdown is a way to make fancy documents.
Make sure you "Knit" often -- after every major change -- to mitigate errors.
Hashtags are how we make section levels to a document

# First level
## Second level 
### Third level 
#### Fourth level 
##### Fifth level

# Basic formatting 

This is **bold** (that's double asterisks) or *italicised* with single asterisks. 
Or `code`

`Command` + `shift` + `K` to Knit 

- this is the start of a list.
- next item. 
- next item. Make sure to have spaces at the end of item. 

1. this is a numbered list. 
2. second item. 

To add a hyperlink, do `[link text]{url}`. without backticks.
For example, [go here]{https://www.sewanee.edu}

To link to sections of your document, do `[link text](#section-name)`, without
backticks. For example, [First level](# First level)

To add more vertical space between blocks of text, use this: "&nbsp;" without quotes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Should be more space now.

**To include an image -- fun!**
first put an image inside the folder where your `Rmd` file is located.
Then type `![](full_image_filename_here){width="50%"}`

![](../images/20250627-DSC_6381 copy.jpg){width="50%"}

#RMarkdown

`RMarkdown` is just `Markdown with `R` code woven in.

You can R stuff in the same line as text. For example, `r 3 + 3` will show as 6.
(It would like backtick lower-case-r space then code then backtick).

You can also do a full multi-line CHUNK of R stuff:

```{r chunk-name }
#```{r}
3 + 3 
#```
```

Settings to show how R chunks appear:

- `eval=TRUE`: which actually runs the code; if `FALSE`, it shows the code but
doesn't run it.
- `echo = TRUE`: which shows the code; if `FALSE`, the code can run without
being shown. 
- `warnings = FALSE`: which will turn off warnings. 
- `fig.cap = "figure caption"` adds a figure caption.
- `fig.width = 7` example of figure width.
- `fig.height = 4` example of figure height.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# this will be shown but not evaluated
3+3
```

```{r read data, }
library(readr)
energy <- read.csv("IRENA data.csv", skip=1)

```

```{r explore data, }
library(dplyr)
energy %>% names
energy %>% head
energy %>% tail
energy %>% pull(Technology) %>% unique %>% sort

energy %>% group_by(Country.area) %>% summarize()
```
